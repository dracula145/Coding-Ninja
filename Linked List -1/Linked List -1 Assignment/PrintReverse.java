/*

You have been given a singly linked list of integers. Write a 
function to print the list in a reverse order.
To explain it further, you need to start printing the data from the 
tail and move towards the head of the list, printing the head data at the end.

Note :
You canâ€™t change any of the pointers in the linked list, just print it in the reverse order.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^3
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.
Sample Input 1 :
1
1 2 3 4 5 -1
Sample Output 1 :
5 4 3 2 1
Sample Input 2 :
2
1 2 3 -1
10 20 30 40 50 -1
Sample Output 2 :
3 2 1
50 40 30 20 10
