/*

For a given a Binary Tree of integers, replace each of its data with the depth of the tree.
Root is at depth 0, hence the root data is updated with 0. Replicate the same further going down the in 
the depth of the given tree.
The modified tree will be printed in the in-order fashion.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1sec
 Sample Input 1:
2 35 10 2 3 5 2 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 
Sample Output 1:
2 1 2 0 2 1 2 
 Sample Input 2:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
Sample Output 2:
2 1 2 0 2 1 2
